# playable-web-collection
A little collection of simple web mini-games built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  I made this mostly to play around and see what I could put together as a beginner messing with front-end stuff.  Nothing too serious; just a place for fun experiments, tiny games, and whatever ideas come to mind along the way :)
